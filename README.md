#### Minimalistic Game in Javascript

This is just a tiny browser game written in Javascript using canvas. The hero
has a limited amount of time to collect coins which briefly appear around him.

The idea is to show the building blocks of a Javascript game which can be used
to create other simple games - how to draw on canvas, how to move the hero with
keys, how to play sounds, detect collisions, run the game loop, etc.
